## Quotez - Your Daily Dose of Inspiration

   Introducing my app "Quotez", a quotes app made with GetX, Rapid API, and it also contains Dark Mode Theme! ðŸŒ™

## Features
  GetX Framework: I chose GetX for its simplicity and powerful state management capabilities. 
  It made the development process a breeze, allowing me to focus on creating a seamless user experience.
  Rapid API Integration: With Rapid API, I was able to access an extensive collection of inspirational quotes from various sources worldwide. 
  This integration enables the app to deliver fresh, meaningful quotes to users daily.
  Local Database for Favorites: To enhance user experience, I implemented a local database to store and manage favorite quotes. 
  Now, users can save their most cherished quotes and revisit them anytime, even without an internet connection.
  Dark Mode Theme: To make the app visually appealing and suitable for all lighting conditions, I incorporated a stunning dark mode theme. 
  Users can now enjoy reading inspiring quotes even in low-light environments.

## Purpose
  Why I Built this App:
  The main purpose of it is to have a quote at an instance without any hindrance. 
  Also, it has a share button to share the quote as well.

Future Plans
ðŸ“ˆ Future Plans:
I'm dedicated to continuously improving the app based on user feedback and needs. 
I plan to add more features, such as sharing quotes on social media, personalization options, 
and curated collections based on specific themes or authors.
